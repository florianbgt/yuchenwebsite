        Axial compressor performance prediction using AI & ML techniques
      </strong>
      </div>
      <ul class="pl-3">
        <li>
          Use AutoKeras to build deep learning models to predict axial compressor performance, with metrics efficiencies and pressure rate.
          Automatically find the best model architecture and hyperparameters accordingly given different compressor features as input results in prediction efficiencies and pressure rate error (RMSE) around 1e-5.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use Gaussian Mixture models (GMM) to generate a synthetic dataset that has similar statistical distribution with the current dataset to improve modelsâ€™ performance on a small dataset.
          Result in RMSE improves from 1e-4 to 1e-5 by adding the synthetic data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deliver a ready-to-use model for automating turbomachinery design that enables people with limited machine learning backgrounds to use the models easily, saving the cost of design and smoothing the collaboration between the AI research team and the engineering team.
          Deliver reports, visualize results, and explain to non-machine learning background audiences and other collaborative teams.
